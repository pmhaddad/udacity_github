When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Using a remote repository is useful when collaborating, or when - for some reason - one has to work on
	different machines on the course of the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?
	One might want to pull changes manually to make sure the commits that will be brought to the local repository
	are pertinent. The remote repository is on-line, and as such, may be edited by other users.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A clone is a full copy of a repository, including its files and their history. The copy can be made from a remote
	repo to a local repo, or even from a local repo to another local repo.
	A fork is a full copy of a repository, just as a clone. But both the original repo and the copy are 
	hosted on GitHub.
	A branch is a copy of a repository separated by the original repo by the use of a different tag. It is used to 
	create a separate path for experimentation on files being tracked by Git. It is a commit that stores all files 
	in the status when the branch is created.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	The benefit of having a local copy of the last known state of the remote repo is that is allows one to track
	changes that are made independently on the local and remote repos, including changes by different people.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	To be completely honest, I have no clue ;)
