What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Git sets up the necessary "infrastructure" to start version control on that directory (which is now a repository).
	You need to use init to set up the environment.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The working directory represents the current situation of the directory as understood by the user OS.
	The repository represents the current situation of the directory as Git understand it.
	The staging area is different from both the wd and the repo, because it is only a temporary vessel for changes.
	We use the staging area to register the current state of part/the whole wd and then commit these versions into the repository.
	Also, the staging area allows one to undo any change, before submitting it to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	One can use the staging area to make sure which changes are ready to be committed. It serves as a "draft" before the commit.
	One can put and remove files from the staging area before committing, etc.
	It also allows for one to make a lot of changes at once, in several files, even if they are not on the same logical change.
	With the staging area, one can divide this group of changes in logical groups.
