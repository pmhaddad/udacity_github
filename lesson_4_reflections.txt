When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	Using a remote repository is useful when collaborating, or when - for some reason - one has to work on
	different machines on the course of the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?
	One might want to pull changes manually to make sure the commits that will be brought to the local repository
	are pertinent. The remote repository is online, and as such, may be edited by other users.
